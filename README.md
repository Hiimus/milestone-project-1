## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Project goals

 The goal of this project is to let the user know that this gym is leaning towards barbell strength training. One of the goals is to get attention and interest even though the user doesn't have much or any experience with this type of training. Styrk Gym is a place that welcomes all types of people. Compared to other gyms, Styrk is more leaned towards compound movements and the sport of lifting. Here, the user can expect squat racks, benches, open spaces  and more. And not rows of threadmills, bikes and your typical cardio equipment. There will be lots of room for acitivity.

## Design

The design should represent a gym that focus on barbell movements and compound movements, but also a gym that includes all kinds of people. A friendly enviroment is important to make everyone feel welcome.  

Backgrounds and images: 
The background images for the landing page have been selected because they fit the project goals: To give the user an impression of this being a lifting-based gym, and a gym that includes everyone. That is why the desktop version has a woman squatting with a barbell, and the mobile version has barbell from ground view. 
At the bottom of the landing page, there are two guys fist-bumping, which can give a sense of a good enviroment among members.
The gallery provide images that gives the user an idea of what kind of equipment to expect, images of people training, stretching and having fun.

Fonts: I wanted the logo to be down to earth and a little playful. After a look through the google font library the lobster font just seemed perfect for my project. 
In the "We offer" section of the landing page, the bootstrap "lead" class have been selected because I personally think it looks good.

Styling: X colors have been used throughout the page.

Icons: Icons from fontawesome have been used to display email, telephone and social media in the footer. The email and telephone icons is also used in the contact page.


This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Wireframes:  [here](wireframes/)
